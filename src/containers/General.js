      question: 'What is DRY?',
      answer:

      question: 'Explain the Single Responsibility Principle.',
      answer:
        'Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module, or funtion.',

        'Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Explain the Liskov Substitution Principle.',
      answer:
        'If "S" is a subtype of "T", then objects of type "T" in a program may be replaced with objects of type "S" without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.',

      question: 'Explain the Dependency Inversion Principle.',
      answer:
        'A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces). B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.',
